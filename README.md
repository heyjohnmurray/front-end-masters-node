# Node Notes for Front End Masters Workshop

This is where I'm keeping all of my notes and code for the frontendmasters.com Node video series.

## Developing and Debugging

It probably makes sense for you to use (nodemon) [https://github.com/remy/nodemon] to run node apps so you don't always have to kill and restart the application in terminal.

	npm install -g nodemon		

Debugging has changed since this guy taught the course. Now it's done using (just the word 'debug') [https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html]. 

	node debug app.js
	
Now the app is running debug on port 5858.
